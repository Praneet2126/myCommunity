  {"user": "Sanya", "message": "Yesss! I'm so bored of work. I need some beach time."},
  {"user": "Vikram", "message": "I'm in, but can we avoid the super crowded places like Baga? Maybe some South Goa vibes?"},
  {"user": "Neha", "message": "I want to see some historical stuff too. Like old churches or forts. Not just beaches."},
  {"user": "Arjun", "message": "As long as there's good food and maybe some water sports, I'm happy."},
  {"user": "Priya", "message": "I'm with Vikram. Let's keep it chill. No crazy loud parties please."},
  {"user": "Rohan", "message": "Okay, so South Goa for peace? Neha, any specific forts you have in mind?"},
  {"user": "Neha", "message": "Maybe Cabo de Rama or something? I heard it's beautiful."},
  {"user": "Sanya", "message": "Is there scuba diving in South Goa? I really want to try that."},
  {"user": "Arjun", "message": "I think Palolem area has some options. Or maybe Grand Island trip?"},
  {"user": "Vikram", "message": "Grand Island might be too far if we stay south. Let's look for something closer."},
  {"user": "Priya", "message": "Can we find a place that's quiet but has nice shacks? Good seafood is a must."},
  {"user": "Rohan", "message": "I found this place called Sadolxem Bridge. Looks very quiet and scenic."},

  {"user": "Sanya", "message": "That's Our Lady of Immaculate Conception. It's iconic! We have to go there."},
  {"user": "Arjun", "message": "If we go to Panjim, we can check out the bird sanctuary nearby too."},
  {"user": "Vikram", "message": "Dr. Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary? That sounds cool. Very different from the usual beach stuff."},
  {"user": "Priya", "message": "Is it a lot of walking? My ankle is still a bit weak from the trek last month."},
  {"user": "Arjun", "message": "It's mostly boat rides through mangroves, so less walking for you Priya!"},

  {"user": "Neha", "message": "Yes! Sal backwaters are supposed to be very calm."},
  {"user": "Arjun", "message": "I'm down for that. What about temples? I heard Goa has some really unique ones."},
  {"user": "Priya", "message": "The Shantadurga temple looks amazing in photos. Very different architecture."},
  {"user": "Rohan", "message": "Adding that to the list. So basically an 'Offbeat Goa' trip."},
  {"user": "Sanya", "message": "Love it. No Baga/Calangute madness."},
  {"user": "Vikram", "message": "Wait, Arjun wanted water sports. Is kayaking enough adventure for you?"},
  {"user": "Arjun", "message": "Yeah, kayaking is fine. Maybe some dolphin spotting too?"},
  {"user": "Neha", "message": "Palolem is great for dolphin trips early morning."},
  {"user": "Priya", "message": "Okay, so South/Central Goa focus. Quiet beaches, heritage, nature, and boat trips."},
  {"user": "Rohan", "message": "Should we check out the spice plantations too? I heard they serve amazing traditional lunch."},
  {"user": "Sanya", "message": "Savoi Plantation! I've heard great things about their food."},
  {"user": "Vikram", "message": "Done. This sounds like a solid plan. Not too hectic, lots of variety."},
  {"user": "Neha", "message": "How many days are we looking at? 4-5?"},
  {"user": "Rohan", "message": "Yeah, 4 days should be enough to cover these without rushing."},
  {"user": "Priya", "message": "Can we make sure we have time for just sitting on the beach and watching sunsets?"},
  {"user": "Sanya", "message": "Absolutely. That's the main goal!"},
  {"user": "Arjun", "message": "I'll start looking for some nice villas in the south then."},
  {"user": "Vikram", "message": "Make sure it's near a quiet beach. Varca or Majorda maybe?"},
  {"user": "Neha", "message": "Majorda is nice. Great bakeries there too."},
  {"user": "Rohan", "message": "Okay guys, I'm summarizing: South Goa base, Heritage (Panjim/Old Goa), Nature (Bird Sanctuary/Backwaters), and Culture (Temples/Plantations)."},
  {"user": "Priya", "message": "Sounds perfect. Can't wait!"},
